- Developed and implemented image classification models using Python, sklearn, and TensorFlow, leveraging datasets like Iris and CIFAR-10 for accurate predictions and improved model performance. 
- Applied advanced data preprocessing techniques such as data splitting, one-hot encoding, and feature reshaping, enhancing model training and evaluation processes. 
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas and NumPy, extracting meaningful insights from datasets and visualizing relationships to inform model-building decisions.
